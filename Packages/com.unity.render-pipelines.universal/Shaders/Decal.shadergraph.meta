    description: 'This is the default decal shader that comes with URP. It projects
      a color and normal along a single axis.

      

      In order to use decals
      in URP, you''ll need to add the Decal Renderer Feature to URP''s Renderer Data
      asset. In HDRP, decals work automatically so no settings changes are required.

      

      You
      can add a decal to your scene by right-clicking in your scene''s Hierarchy
      panel and selecting Rendering->URP Decal Projector. Then select the new Decal
      Projector and assign it a material that uses your Shader Graph asset.
